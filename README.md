# [From Nand to Tetris: Building A Modern Computer From First Principles](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) 

Nand2Tetris is an educational project that teaches computer science principles through the creation of a computer from the ground up. It consists of a series of projects in which students build a computer system piece by piece, starting with simple logic gates (using the NAND gate as a building block) and working their way up to creating a simple computer capable of running a high-level programming language.

One of the unique features of Nand2Tetris is that it is meant to be accessible to people of all skill levels. The projects are designed to be self-contained and easy to understand, making it an ideal learning resource for those new to computer science. Additionally, the Nand2Tetris course is very thorough and free.

This winter, I have received funding from the Gould Center through the 2022 Winter Passion Project. I plan to complete the first four projects of Nand2Tetris and evaluate their accessibility. Along the way, I will write reflections and share my solutions under an MIT License, allowing anyone to use them however they see fit.
